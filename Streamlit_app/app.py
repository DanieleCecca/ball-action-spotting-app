### Overview
Ball Action Spotting is a cutting-edge feature designed to accurately identify the type of
ball-related actions in football matches. This feature is capable of detecting actions across 12 distinct
classes in our extensive dataset, each action marked by a precise timestamp.

### Key Features

- **Comprehensive Action Detection**: The app identifies 12 different classes of soccer ball actions.
### Soccer Ball Actions Detected

In 2024, our app's capabilities have been extended to detect the following 12 classes of soccer ball actions:

| **Action**                | **Action**                  | **Action**                 |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------|----------------------------|
| Pass                       | Header                      | Ball Player Block           |
| Drive                      | High Pass                   | Player Successful Tackle    |
| Out                        | Cross                       | Free Kick                   |
| Throw In                   | Shot                        | Goal                        |

### Enhanced Analysis
With the Ball Action Spotting app, users can gain deep insights into the dynamics of soccer games,
improving both performance analysis and strategic planning. Whether you are a coach, analyst, or 
enthusiast, our app provides the tools you need to understand and optimize soccer performance.'''
